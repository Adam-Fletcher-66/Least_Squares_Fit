# Least_Squares_Fit

This C++ code finds the best fit line of a set of data points on a graph using the method of least-squares fit. The program will read in x and y data columns from a text file, organize them into arrays, apply the least-squares fit to the data, and calculate a slope and y-intercept which will be the line of best fit. The program will then write out the data points along with the values of the best fit line as a function of the ith x data point to an ASCII file declared by the user.
